# ShieldX

ShieldX is a Windows-based cybersecurity tool built to identify common security threats and system weaknesses in real-world environments.
It focuses on visibility, misconfiguration awareness, and early threat detection rather than heavy enterprise features.

The tool is designed for learning, research, and defensive security testing.

#Modules

Analyzes URLs to identify suspicious or potentially malicious links commonly used in phishing attacks.

 - Misconfiguration Detection

Scans the system and connected network to detect open ports, exposed services, and insecure configurations that increase attack surface.

 - Zero-Day Threat Detection

Monitors system and network behavior to identify anomalies that may indicate unknown or emerging threats.

#Platform

ShieldX currently supports Windows systems.
Some features may require administrative privileges.
