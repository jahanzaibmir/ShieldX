# ShieldX

🛡️ ShieldX

ShieldX is a Windows-based cybersecurity tool focused on detecting practical, real-world security threats that often slip past basic protections.
It is built with a defensive mindset and emphasizes visibility, misconfiguration awareness, and early threat detection rather than heavy enterprise features.

This project is primarily intended for learning, research, and defensive security testing in Windows environments.

What is ShieldX

ShieldX combines multiple security checks into a single tool that helps users understand what is happening on their system and network.
Instead of relying only on known signatures, it looks at configuration issues, exposed services, suspicious links, and abnormal behavior.

The goal is not to replace enterprise security solutions, but to provide clarity and insight into common weaknesses that attackers frequently exploit.

Core Modules
Phishing Link Detection

This module focuses on identifying suspicious and potentially malicious URLs.
It helps users analyze links before interacting with them and highlights patterns commonly used in phishing attacks.
The module is useful for awareness, testing, and basic link reputation analysis.

Misconfiguration Detection

The misconfiguration module scans the local system and the network the device is connected to.
It detects open ports, exposed services, insecure settings, and configuration mistakes that could increase attack surface.
This module is designed to reveal issues that are often ignored during regular system usage.

Zero-Day Threat Detection

The zero-day detection module monitors system and network behavior instead of relying purely on known signatures.
It focuses on anomalies, unexpected activity, and unusual patterns that may indicate unknown or emerging threats.
This approach helps surface suspicious behavior even when no known exploit signature exists.

Why ShieldX Was Built

Many existing security tools are either too complex, locked behind enterprise paywalls, or abstracted to the point where users cannot understand what is actually happening.
ShieldX was created to stay simple, transparent, and educational while still being practical.

It is especially useful for students, security learners, and developers who want hands-on exposure to how defensive tools think and operate.

Platform Support

ShieldX is currently designed to run on Windows systems.
Some modules interact directly with system and network components, so administrative privileges may be required for full functionality.

Intended Use

ShieldX is intended for defensive security testing, learning, and research.
It should only be used on systems and networks that you own or have explicit permission to test.

Misuse of this tool against unauthorized targets may be illegal and unethical.

Project Status

ShieldX is under active development.
Features, detection logic, and internal structure may change as the project evolves.
Feedback, testing, and contributions are welcome.
